// maker-bot — a two-sided POST-ONLY market maker for DreamDEX event contracts.
// For each active market it quotes a symmetric bid + ask around a fair YES
// probability, refreshing every cycle (cancel stale → re-quote). This is the
// piece the in-repo examples lack: a resting-liquidity provider, not a taker.
//
// How it stays safe:
//   • POST-ONLY (timeInForce "PO") — a quote that would cross the book is
//     rejected instead of taking, so the maker never pays the spread.
//   • Gates on the AUTHORITATIVE on-chain status (never the lagging indexer).
//   • Mints a YES/NO set once (mint-a-pair) so the SELL-YES side is
//     collateralised — you can't sell an outcome you don't hold.
//   • Cancels its own resting orders before re-quoting, so it never stacks
//     duplicate levels or self-matches (the venue blocks self-matches anyway).
//
// Fair value here is deliberately simple — the mid of the current YES book, or
// 0.5 when a side is empty. Swap in your own signal (an external price, a model)
// to actually make money; the plumbing around it is the point.
//
// DRY_RUN=true (default) logs the quotes it would place. Set DRY_RUN=false + a
// funded PRIVATE_KEY to quote for real.
//
